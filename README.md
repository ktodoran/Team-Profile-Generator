## Additional Thoughts

For future development, we would consider:

* Buffing the input validation to ensure only numbers are inputted for items like employee ID or Office #. Would also like to make sure a proper email address is inputted into the email address question.
* Additional styling to delineate between Manager, Engineer, and Intern.
